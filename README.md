# Family Travel Tracker Project [<img src="/public/images/world.png" width="60" height="60" />](https://<add>.onrender.com/)

Family Travel Tracker is a full-stack project enabling family members to register as users and track visited countries. Users can mark countries they've visited and view collective travel data, including the total number of countries visited by each family member. 

## Technologies

- **PostgreSQL**: Utilized as the database to store user information securely.
- **Express.js**: Provided a robust backend framework.
- **Node.js**: Facilitated server-side scripting.
- **JavaScript**: Predominantly used for both backend and frontend logic.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templates for server-side HTML rendering.
- **HTML and CSS**: Utilized for structuring and styling the user interface.

## Deployment 

In the deployment strategy for the Family Travel Tracker project, Render was chosen as the hosting platform. Render's robust support for PostgreSQL databases.
